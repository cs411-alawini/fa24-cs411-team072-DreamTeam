## Project Summary

  Ticket Masterer is a platform that joins several online event ticket marketplacesâ€™
offerings into a unified shopping experience. Users can then search for events and find
the best ticket deals across all marketplaces. Search results include the product name,
description, price, images, and the marketplace link. Users will also be able to sort
results by those fields.
  When a user finds a ticket they like, they can add it to their personal wishlist,
which organizes their selected products by marketplace for easy checkout. The platform
will pull data from StubHub, ETickets, Sports Illustrated Tickets, Tickets.com, FeverUp,
Vivid Seats, and MainLineTix. Because each of these datasets includes the date, time,
and location of each event, determining which events are the same will be trivial.
